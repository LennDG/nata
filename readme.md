# Nata
**Nata** is an entity management library for LÃ–VE. It can be used in a traditional OOP style or a minimal ECS style.

Nata lets you create **entity pools**, which hold all of the objects in your game world, such as platforms, enemies, and collectables.

## Installation
To use Nata, place `nata.lua` in your project, and then add this code to your `main.lua`:
```lua
nata = require 'nata' -- if your nata.lua is in the root directory
nata = require 'path.to.nata' -- if it's in subfolders
```

## Usage - OOP style
In the traditional OOP (object oriented programming) style, an entity is a table that contains both **data** and **functions**. For example, a player entity may have `x` and `y` variables for position, as well as functions such as `jump`. Generally, all entities will have some of the same functions, such as `update` or `draw`, which contain behavior unique to that entity.

### Creating an entity pool
```lua
pool = nata.new()
```
Creates a pool which holds entities.

### Queueing entities to be added to the pool
```lua
entity = pool:queue(entity, ...)
```
Adds an entity to the queue and returns it. Additional arguments are stored to be passed to `entity.add` when the queue is flushed.

### Adding queued entities
```lua
pool:flush()
```
Adds all of the entities in the queue to the pool. For each entity, `entity:add(...)` will be called (if it exists), where `...` is the arguments passed to `pool.queue`.

### Calling an event for all entities
```lua
pool:call(event, ...)
```
For each entity, this will run `entity:[event](...)` if the entity has a function called `event`. Any additional arguments passed to `pool.call` will be passed to each entity's function.

### Calling an event for a single entity
```lua
pool:callOn(entity, event, ...)
```

### Getting entities
```lua
entities = pool:get(f)
```
Returns a table containing all the entities for which `f(entity)` returns true. For example, this code will return a table with all the entities that are marked as "solid":
```lua
solidEntities = pool:get(function(entity)
  return entity.solid
end)
```
If no function is provided, `pool:get()` will return every entity.

### Removing entities
```lua
pool:remove(f)
```
Removes all the entities for which `f(entity)` returns true and calls the "remove" event on each entity that is removed.

## Usage - ECS style
While object oriented programming is a powerful metaphor, the **Entity Component System** pattern can offer greater flexibility and avoid some of the problems with inheritance. With ECS, entities primarily contain **data** rather than functions, and systems act on entities depending on what components they have.

Using Nata in the ECS style is almost exactly the same as using it in the OOP style, except you pass a list of systems to `nata.new`.
```lua
pool = nata.new(systems)
```
Each system is a table with an optional filter, an optional sort function, and a function for each event it should respond to. Each event function will receive an entity as the first argument, followed by any additional arguments passed to `pool.call`, `pool.callOn`, `pool.add`, or `pool.remove`. For example, a gravity system might look like this:
```lua
GravitySystem = {
  filter = {'vy', 'gravity'}
  update = function(entity, dt)
    entity.vy = entity.vy + entity.gravity * dt
  end,
}
```

### Filters
Systems can optionally have a filter that defines which entities a system should act on. Filters can either be defined as a table or a function.

When `system.filter` is a table, the system will act on any entity that has all of the keys defined in the table. For example, this system will only act on entities that have `vx` and `vy` defined.

```lua
VelocitySystem = {
  filter = {'vx', 'vy'},
  update = function(entity, dt)
    entity.x = entity.x + entity.vx * dt
    entity.y = entity.y + entity.vy * dt
  end
}
```

When `system.filter` is a function, the system will only on entities for which `f(entity)` returns true. For example, this system will only act on entities that have a `vx` and `vy` of 10 or greater.

```lua
FrictionSystem = {
  filter = function(entity)
    return entity.vx > 10 and entity.vy > 10
  end,
  update = function(entity, dt)
    entity.vx = entity.vx + (0 - entity.vx) * 10 * dt
    entity.vy = entity.vy + (0 - entity.vy) * 10 * dt
  end
}
```

### Sorting
By default, each system will process entities in the order they were added to the pool. You can change the order each system processes entities by defining the function `system.sort`. The function should take two arguments representing two entities and return true if the first entity should be processed before the second entity.

Note that entities are only sorted when they are first added; the order of processing will not change otherwise.

### Hybrid OOP/ECS style

Nata's OOP functionality is implemented as a single system that passes every event (except for "filter" and "sort") to the entity. If you want to use this system in combination with other systems, add `nata.oop()` to the `systems` table.
